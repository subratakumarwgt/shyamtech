##Guidelines 
1. Use Git to manage the source code. A clear Git history showing your process is
required. 
2. Structure your code according to industry best practice design patterns. 
3. Scrolling the list should be smooth, even as images are downloading and getting
added to the cells. 
4. Comment your code when necessary. 
5. Commit your changes to git in small chunks with meaningful comments.
